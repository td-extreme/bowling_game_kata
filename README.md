# bowling game kata

setup I use for demoing doing the bowling game kata

----

`make restart` - to clear both the Game.java and BowlingGameTest.java files.

`./watcher.sh` - is the script to run the watcher. It will rebuild and run the test anytime that you make a save to either file.

`./stopwatch.sh` - is a timer that changes color ever 2 minutes and stops when it hits 16 minutes.
